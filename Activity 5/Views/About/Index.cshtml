                Hi! I'm a Computer Engineering student currently studying at Angeles University Foundation.
                I have a passion for technology, software development, and problem-solving.
                My interests include web development, networking, and embedded systems.

            <p>
                I'm constantly learning new technologies to enhance my skills and apply them in real-world projects.
                This portfolio showcases my work and projects that I've developed during my studies. Feel free to explore and reach out!
